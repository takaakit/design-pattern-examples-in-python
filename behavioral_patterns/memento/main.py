'''
A dice game in which money increases and decreases:
* A gamer shakes a dice and the number determine the next state.
* If the number of dice is even, gamer's money doubles, and if it is odd, gamer's money is halved.
* If the gamer's money is less than half of the highest amount, it returns to the highest amount.
* The game is repeated.
