A trouble is turned around among supporters, and the trouble will be handled by the supporter who can handle it.
There are four types of supporters below:
* LazySupporter doesn't handle any trouble
* MoodySupporter handles odd ID troubles
* SpecialSupporter handles a trouble of the target ID.
* LimitedSupporter handles troubles below the limit ID.
